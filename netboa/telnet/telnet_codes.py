#
# Negotiating a Local Option
# --------------------------
#
# Side A begins with:
#
#    "IAC WILL/WONT XX"   Meaning "I would like to [use|not use] option XX."
#
# Side B replies with either:
#
#    "IAC DO XX"     Meaning "OK, you may use option XX."
#    "IAC DONT XX"   Meaning "No, you cannot use option XX."
#
#
# Negotiating a Remote Option
# ----------------------------
#
# Side A begins with:
#
#    "IAC DO/DONT XX"  Meaning "I would like YOU to [use|not use] option XX."
#
# Side B replies with either:
#
#    "IAC WILL XX"   Meaning "I will begin using option XX"
#    "IAC WONT XX"   Meaning "I will not begin using option XX"
#
#
# The syntax is designed so that if both parties receive simultaneous requests
# for the same option, each will see the other's request as a positive
# acknowledgement of it's own.
#
# If a party receives a request to enter a mode that it is already in, the
# request should not be acknowledged. Where you see DE in my comments I mean
# 'Distant End', e.g. the user's Telnet program.

UNKNOWN = -1
